## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
I mainly had challenges with figuring out how to make a sticky navigation bar since it's been a while. I read a lot of guides on flexbox
and navigation bar creations to help me build my navigation bar!
This was also my first time implementing a search function, so I had to read up on the documentations for the "search" implementation
type. Overall, it was a fun experience working on revamping the website while solving for the secret codes.
